#### Cloud storage has 4 primary storage classes

1\. Standard storage

* standard storage is considered best for frequently accessed, or "hot" data.
* It's also great for data that is stored for only brief preiods of time.

2\. Nearline storage

* Best for storing infrequently accessed data, like reading or modifying data once per month or less. Examples include data backups, long-tail multimedia content, or data archiving.

3. Coldline storage

* Low-cost option for storing infrequently accessed data.
* Reading or modifying data at most once every 90 days.

4. Archive storage

* Lowest-cost option, used ideally for data archiving, online backup, and disaster recovery.
* For data to access less than once a year.



#### Structured Data

structured data comes in two types:

1. Transactional workloads

* Which are used when fast data inserts and updates are required to build row-based records.
* Usually to maintain a system snapshot.
* Require relatively standardized queries that impact only a few records.

2. Analytical workloads

* Which are used when entire datasets need to be read.
* Often require complex queries, for example, aggregations.
